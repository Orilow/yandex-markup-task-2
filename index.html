                Scientists are using computational models of the brain to simulate how the
                structure of the brain may impact brain activity and, ultimately, human behavior.
                The research focuses on interconnectivity, looking at how different regions
                are linked to and interact with one another (traits that vary between individuals).

            <h2>Mars: Oxygen-rich, life-supporting liquid water?</h2>
            <p>
                A team led by scientists at Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), 
                which Caltech manages for NASA, has calculated that if liquid water exists on Mars,
                it could -- under specific conditions -- contain more oxygen than previously thought 
                possible. According to the model, the levels could even theoretically exceed the
                threshold needed to support simple aerobic life.
            </p>
            <p>
                That finding runs contrary to the current, accepted view of Mars and its potential 
                for hosting habitable environments. The existence of liquid water on Mars is not a
                given. Even if it is there, researchers have long dismissed the idea that it might
                be oxygenated, given that Mars's atmosphere is about 160 times thinner than that 
                of Earth and is mostly carbon dioxide.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>
                    Oxygen is a key ingredient when determining the habitability of an environment, but
                    it is relatively scarce on Mars,
                </q>
                says Woody Fischer, professor of geobiology at 
                Caltech and a co-author of a Nature Geoscience paper on the findings, which were 
                published on October 22.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>
                    Nobody ever thought that the concentrations of dissolved oxygen needed for 
                    aerobic respiration could theoretically exist on Mars,
                </q>
                adds JPL's Vlada Stamenković,
                lead author of the Nature Geoscience paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finding liquid water on Mars is one of the major goals of NASA's Mars program. 
                In recent months, data from a European spacecraft have suggested that liquid water
                may lie beneath a layer of ice at Mars's south pole. It has also been hypothesized
                that water could exist in salty subsurface pools, because perchlorate salts
                (compounds of chlorine and oxygen) have been detected at various places on Mars.
                Salt lowers the freezing point of water, which means that water with perchlorate
                in it could potentially stay liquid despite the freezing temperatures on Mars,
                where summer nights on the equator can still dip down to -100 degrees Fahrenheit.

            <h2>Mystery at the center of the Milky Way solved</h2>
            <p>
                Astronomers from Lund University in Sweden have now found the explanation to 
                a recent mystery at the centre of the Milky Way galaxy: the high levels of scandium
                discovered last spring near the galaxy's giant black hole were in fact an optical 
                illusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                The spectral lines for different elements are recorded in a high-resolution spectrometer
                -- an advanced camera that generates a rainbow of the starlight. The research team has 
                studied the part of the spectrum consisting of near-infrared light, i.e. the heat 
                radiation emitted by the stars. The reason for this is that infrared light can 
                penetrate the dust that obstructs the line-of-sight between us and the centre of 
                the Milky Way, approximately 25,000 light years away. The technology for recording 
                this light is very advanced, and has only recently become available to astronomers.

                <q>
                    We have only started to map the stellar compositions in these central areas of 
                    the Milky Way,
                </q>
